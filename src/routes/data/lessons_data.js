The name <span class="pali">Khujjhuttarā</span> was given to her because she had been born with a deformed back (<span class="pali">khujja</span>- bent). It is said that in one of her past lives she had imitated a Pacceka Buddha, who was a hunchback. Despite her position as a slave-girl (because in another previous life she had treated a nun like her servant-girl) she had the capacity of quick understanding and the ability to memorize whatever she heard. This was a result of a situation when she proved fast thinking in a previous life, where she quickly presented bracelets to Pacceka Buddhas, who had trouble holding extremely hot food in their bowls). Her main duty under queen <span class="pali">Samāvāti</span> had been to procure a fresh bouquet of flowers everyday. It had been her habit to buy only half a bunch of flowers and to keep the other half of money for herself. This attitude changed when she listened to a discourse of the Buddha one day, which inspired her to present the correct amount of flowers to the queen. The queen was surprised by the large amount of beautiful flowers on that day and was accordingly informed about the past bad habit. But instead of rebuking <span class="pali">Kujjhuttarā</span>, the Queen <span class="pali">Samāvāti</span> instructed her with a new task: From hence on she had to go and listen to the discourses of the Buddha and to repeat them to her every day. The collection of these suttas constitutes the <span class="pali">Itivuttakapāḷi</span>.</p>`
