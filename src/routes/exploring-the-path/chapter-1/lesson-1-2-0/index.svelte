    <p>This chapter is titled ‘dullabho’ – ‘ so rare’ as it presents original texts where the Buddha himself indicates
        how rare it is to encounter the teaching of the Enlightened One, to hear the Dhamma –‘saddhammassavanaṃ’– and
        being able, because of this, to actually walk the path as so generously laid out by the Buddha. Therefore these
        lovely lines are chosen as introductory verses, introducing the language of the Dhammapada.</p>
    <p>One of the intention of this ‘Exploring the Path’ (ETP) is to acquaint the reader with various texts from
        different sources in the Tipiṭaka. While the first lesson chose a sutta from the Itivuttaka the current verse is
        selected from the most famous and most often translated book, the Dhammapada.</p>
    <p>The Dhammapada expresses in its 432 verses in altogether 26 chapters succinctly the essence of the Buddha’s
        teaching in linguistic and poetical magnificence. Many verses likewise appear in different other texts as well
        and various verses will be quoted in this ETP.</p>
    <p>This verse, the fourth of the Buddhavaggo was uttered by the Buddha to ease the despair of a king of dragons by
        the name of Erakapatta. This king had once in his previous life, in spite of persistent and unblemished efforts
        in his meditation, neglectfully broken a leave of the Erakatree (hence his name: eraka – patta: leaf) when
        passing by boat on a river. Considering it a mere trifle he was therefore reborn as Erakapatta. Waiting during
        the entire, everlasting period of one Buddha for the next to arise, he asked his beautiful daughter to dance and
        sing every fortnight on uposatha-days. He was in this way presenting his daughter to any suitor by hoping that
        for one who would give the proper reply to a riddle she was singing. He knew that this riddle could only be
        solved by someone who had encountered the teaching of the Buddha.</p>
    <p>Finally, after the appearance of Siddhattha, the Brahmin Uttara learned the correct replies to the riddle from
        the Buddha, was successful in his courtship and gained Erakapatta’s full approval for the bride. Full of
        inspiration, knowing that the next Buddha had now appeared Erakapatta went to Siddhattha and weepingly expressed
        his sadness that he had to wait so enduringly long for the next Buddha to appear. The Buddha tried to soothe him
        by stating the facts expressed in this stanza.</p>
    <p>The term: ‘saddhammassavanaṃ’ is a compound ‘saddhamma + savana’ and means ‘listening to the true, ‘existing’
        Dhamma’. The term saddhamma can also be derived from saddhā and dhamma and contains the following seven
        saddhammas: saddha—faith, sati—awareness, hiri—sense of shame, otthappa—moral sense of guilt , bahusacca—ample
        learning, vīriya—diligence and paññā—wisdom. A person who desires to develop deeper in meditation should
        perfectly accomplish these seven saddhammas together with sīla and bhojhanamattaññutā—moderation in eating,
        jāgariyanuyoga—wakefulness and indriyasaṃvara— guarding the sense doors.</p>
