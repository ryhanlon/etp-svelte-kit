<h1>English 2.1.1</h1>
<p class="english-para">This has been said by the Blessed One, it has been said by an Arahant, it has been heard by me.</p>
<p class="english-para">When these three kinds of individuals arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men.</p>
<p class="english-para">Which are the three?</p>
<p class="english-para">Here, oh Bhikkhus, the Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, having reached the final goal, seeing the entire universe, an incomparable trainer of mankind, a teacher of Gods and men, an Enlightened One, a Bhagavā. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the first kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men.</p>
<p class="english-para">Next, oh Bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher who is himself an Arahant—one who has destroyed all impurities, brought himself to perfection and done what ought to be done, laid down the burden and attained his own welfare, shattered the bondages of becoming and is realised through complete knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, it possesses meaning and is well phrased, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the second kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of Gods and men.</p>
<p class="english-para">Further Bhikkhus, there is a disciple of that teacher, under training, full of learning and established in the rules of good conduct. He teaches the Dhamma which is beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the end, with correct wording full of meaning, complete in itself, utterly pure and displaying the holy life.</p>
<p class="english-para">This, oh Bhikkhus, is the third kind of individual that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of Gods and men.</p>
<p class="english-para">These, oh Bhikkhus, are the three kinds of individuals that when they arise in the world, they arise for the well-being of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, the welfare and happiness of gods and men.</p>
<p class="english-para">The Bhagavā explained this matter, in connection of which this was stated:</p>
<p class="english-para">Because for the teacher….</p>
<p class="english-para">This matter was laid down by the Bhagavā, this has been heard by me.</p>

<p class="font-note">The translations in these English headings to the Suttas do not directly resemble the title of the respective Suttas. They rather try to indicate the contents in order to give the reader a quick idea about it. The footnotes here will give the direct and literal translation. The word <span class="pali">sutta</span> remains untranslated. Its meaning is: <em>thread, text, line of…</em>&ndash;and relates in general to the narrational dialogues, mainly collected in the Sutta-piṭaka.</p>
